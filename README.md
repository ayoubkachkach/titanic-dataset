# Introduction to ML Workshop for Computer Science for Innovation club at Al Akhawayn University
Made for the 4th (and final :'( ...) session of an introductory machine learning workshop I led at AUI.
Notebook to demonstrate basic ML workflow and tools (scikit-learn and Pandas) on the titanic challenge in Kaggle.
